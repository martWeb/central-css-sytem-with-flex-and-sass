This project demonstrates creating a central css system for a web project. Often times developers create one big css file for an entire web project. Few days down the lane, maintenance becomes a nightmare. 
What this project, which is the code base for one of my tutorials on frontend design, seeks to achieve is how to develop a central css system with a generic css file that handles responsiveness across all pages therefore promoting maintainability, separa
To test this project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository
From the location where it's cloned to, double the index.html to launch the single page site.
To make changes to any of the sass files, you will need to install node-sass. So, while in the super-klean folder, run " npm install", to install the package
Still in the super-klean folder, run"npm run sass", this will compile continue to watch for any changes to any of the scss files, and recompiles to css.
