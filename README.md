This project demonstrates creating a central css system for a web project. Often times developers create one big css file for an entire web project. Few days down the lane, maintenance becomes a nightmare.
What this project, which is the code base for one of my tutorials on frontend design, seeks to achieve is how to develop a central css system with a generic css file that handles responsiveness across all pages therefore promoting maintainability, separa
To test this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   From the location where it's cloned to, double click the index.html file to launch the single page site.
2. To make changes to any of the sass files, you will need to install node-sass. Open your terminal. navigate to the super-klean folder, run " npm install", to install the package
3. Still in the super-klean folder, run"npm run sass", this will continue to watch for any changes to any of the sass files, and recompiles to css.
